Installation Instructions
*************************

Installation of PyMad is different depending on which underlying modules you want.

For JPyMad, you first need JMad which you can obtain `here <http://cern.ch/jmad/>`

For CPymad on a 64 bit Linux machine with afs available, it is enough to source the script that we 
currently providere in /afs/cern.ch/user/y/ylevinse/public/setupCPYMAD.sh
Note that this location might change without notice.
